# ML-Estimate-the-price-of-cars
In this project, we get some information about used Toyota Cars by crawling truecar.com, and store them in a MySQL database.
Then, we use the data to train our model (which is provided by sklearn library) to estimate prices of Toyota cars by their Model, Product year and Mileage.
